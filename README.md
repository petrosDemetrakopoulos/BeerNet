# BeerNet
A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for generation of beer recipes.

Implemented using the [CTGAN package](https://github.com/sdv-dev/CTGAN) for synthetic data generation.

## Dataset
The model was trained on a slice (kept only "All grain recipes" with up to 5 hops and up to 5 fermentables) of [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/angeredsquid/brewers-friend-beer-recipes) containing 180k Homebrew Beer Recipes from [BrewersFriend.com](https://www.brewersfriend.com/).
